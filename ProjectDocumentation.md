## A fun purchase got the project started
It was actually just a joke and I didn't think I would win the auction with that bid.

The phone was in very good condition for its age and it was too good to just leave it sitting around.

## First Prototype Fit
After the handset worked without any problems, I looked at how the most important components could fit into the case.
