# w3FeTAp
Converting a Fernsprechtischapparat (FeTap) 791-1 into a VoIP phone utilizing a Pi Zero W, Linphone and some Python code. And so an old-fashioned device from the 80s becomes a top modern World Wide Web Telephone Table Device, or in short w3FeTAp.

## Seriously?
Actually, I just wanted to show my kids that phones didn't always look like this. I got the FeTap 791-1 cheaply on eBay and didn't want to let it just sit around uselessly. Fortunately, I came across these two websites, which made it easy for me to get started.
